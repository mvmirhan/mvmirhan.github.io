 This is the repository of my portfolio to showcase what I learned in HTML and CSS from SheCodes Plus 2022 Program.
 My portfolio consisted of 2 web pages.

    The first page or the About Me page consisted of a header section which contains my photo, my brief biography of my professional experience.
    The header also contains a call for action to keep in touch, with a navigation that opens up my contact form.
    This page also contains a section where I can feature my SheCodes projects and a link to the Github repository of the challenges.
    Next section is for my Skills, where I can feature the skills i gained and developed over time in my career.
    Lastly, a footer with another call for action to connect. This section contains link to my social media (LInkedin) and Contact Form. 
    
    The 2nd page of my website open ups via a link from my About Me page to my Contact Form page.
    This page consisted of a header (which has link back to my About Me page), my 2nd photo, forms/input field and submit button.
    It also has footer, with links to social media and About Me Page.

Dear Ali and Mentors
Thank you for patiently teaching us during this session of the program.
I wont be able to complete my portfolio without your guidance and help.
I'm really grateful to be given the opportunity to learn these set of new skills.

Hi ALi - I took a screen recording to demonstrate the features but I wasnt able to commit it to Github. I'll try to send to DM you via slack if it will allow me.

Regards,
Marivic
